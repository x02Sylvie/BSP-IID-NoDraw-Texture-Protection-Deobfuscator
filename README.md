# BSP-IID-NoDraw-Texture-Protection-Deobfuscator
Rough proof-of-concept of reversing one of source engine bsp maps obfuscation methods

# Information
This application is meant as helper if you are attempting to decompile map which uses NoDraw IID obfsucation (every texture being nodraw or some other texture).

# How to use
1. Windows
2. Compile (C++14 standard)
3. Drag .bsp onto .exe
4. Deobfuscated map will be in newly created /finished directory

# Bugs
I didn't spend much time on this project which is why its output may lack accuracy but it was enough to work with for my purposes
